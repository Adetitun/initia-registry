# Initia Registry

This repo contains files `chain.json` and `assetlist.json` for a number of chains in the Initia ecosystem. `chain.json` contains data that makes it easy to start running or interacting with a node.

Schema files containing the recommended metadata structure can be found in the `*.schema.json` files located in the root directory. Schemas are still undergoing revision as user needs are surfaced. Optional fields may be added beyond what is contained in the schema files.
